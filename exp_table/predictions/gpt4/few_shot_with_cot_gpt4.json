      "In the glomerular capillaries, the oncotic pressure actually increases along the length of the capillary because water is filtered out, concentrating the proteins that remain in the capillary blood. The glucose concentration remains the same in the capillaries and the glomerular filtrate because glucose is freely filtered and not reabsorbed or secreted by the glomerulus. Constriction of the afferent arteriole will indeed decrease the blood flow to the glomeruli. The hematocrit of the fluid leaving the capillaries is not less; rather, it is higher due to the filtration of fluid which concentrates the cells that remain in the capillary blood."

There are two types of axonal transport: anterograde, which is the movement of materials from the cell body to the synaptic terminals, and retrograde, which is the movement of materials from the synaptic terminals back to the cell body. Therefore, axonal transport is both antegrade and retrograde."

Glycogen synthesis, on the other hand, is promoted by a high insulin to glucagon ratio, as insulin is an anabolic hormone that promotes storage of glucose as glycogen. Therefore, glycogen synthesis occurs when the insulin to glucagon ratio is high, not low."
