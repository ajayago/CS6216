      "The statement that 'The oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of fluid entering it' is false. The oncotic pressure, also known as colloid osmotic pressure, tends to pull water into the capillaries and it is determined by plasma proteins, which do not filter out through the glomerulus. Therefore, the oncotic pressure of the blood actually increases as it moves along the capillaries from the afferent to the efferent arteriole due to the removal of fluid from the blood by filtration, concentrating the plasma proteins."

      "Axonal transport is the process by which substances are moved along the axon of a neuron. There are two types of axonal transport: antegrade and retrograde. Antegrade transport moves materials from the cell body to the synaptic terminals, while retrograde transport moves materials from the synaptic terminals back to the cell body for recycling or to inform the cell body of conditions at the axon terminals. Therefore, axonal transport includes both antegrade and retrograde movement."

      "A low insulin to glucagon ratio promotes catabolic processes such as glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis, which are all processes that generate glucose and ketone bodies to supply energy during periods of fasting or low carbohydrate intake. Glycogen synthesis, on the other hand, is an anabolic process that requires a higher insulin to glucagon ratio because insulin promotes the storage of glucose as glycogen. Thus, glycogen synthesis would not occur with a low insulin to glucagon ratio."

Each of the given choices represents a different cardiac condition that would have distinct features on an ECG. For instance, 'Ventricular bigeminy' would show a pattern of one normal beat followed by one premature ventricular contraction. 'Electrical alternans' could be associated with pericardial effusion and would show beat-to-beat variations in the QRS complex amplitude. 'P pulmonale' is characterized by peaked P waves indicating right atrial enlargement, typically seen in conditions such as pulmonary hypertension. 'Left ventricular failure' might lead to various ECG changes depending on the severity and chronicity, such as signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. Without the ECG, the correct answer cannot be determined."

Pulmonary atresia is a condition where the pulmonary valve is completely closed or absent, preventing blood from flowing from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery and consequently to the lungs, leading to oligaemic lung fields on X-ray. Ebstein's anomaly may present with cyanosis but typically shows an enlarged heart due to right atrial enlargement. Transposition of great arteries usually presents with a normal or increased pulmonary blood flow pattern on X-ray. Tetralogy of Fallot can present with cyanosis and decreased pulmonary blood flow but commonly shows a boot-shaped heart due to right ventricular hypertrophy."

However, the syringe should be filled with only a minimal amount of heparin (usually around 0.3 mL is too much and may dilute the sample, potentially leading to inaccurate results). The statement that 'Normal pH, HCO3-, and PCO2 levels may not indicate absence of an acid-base imbalance' is true, as compensatory mechanisms can normalize these values in chronic conditions. A negative modified Allen's test indicates inadequate collateral blood flow, and an alternative site should be used for ABG sampling. The radial artery is indeed the preferred site for ABG sampling due to its accessibility and the presence of collateral circulation."
