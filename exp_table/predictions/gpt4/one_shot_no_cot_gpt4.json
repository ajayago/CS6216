In pulmonary atresia, the pulmonary valve is either absent or critically stenotic, which reduces the amount of blood reaching the lungs to be oxygenated, leading to cyanosis. Oligemic lung fields are indicative of decreased pulmonary blood flow, which is consistent with this diagnosis."

However, the syringe should not be loaded with a large volume of heparin as this can dilute the blood sample and alter the test results; usually, only a small amount is used to coat the syringe. The modified Allen's test ensures adequate collateral circulation before arterial puncture. Radial artery is the preferred site for ABG sampling. Normal pH, HCO3, and PCO2 levels can indeed be misleading, as the body may have compensated for an acid-base imbalance."
