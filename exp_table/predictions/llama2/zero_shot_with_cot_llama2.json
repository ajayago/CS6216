      "Glomerular capillaries have a unique structure that allows them to filter waste products from the blood. The oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries is higher than that of fluid entering it, due to the reabsorption of water and ions. Glucose concentration in the capillaries is higher than that in glomerular filtrate, as glucose is actively reabsorbed. Constriction of afferent arteriole decreases blood flow to the glomeruli, which can lead to decreased filtration. Hematocrit of the fluid leaving the capillaries is higher than that of the fluid entering it, due to the reabsorption of water and ions."

This is because the patient may have developed some degree of respiratory muscle weakness during the period of mechanical ventilation, and may not be able to breathe on their own immediately after extubation. Therefore, it is important to assess their respiratory status and provide manual ventilation with a bag and mask if necessary, while simultaneously looking for signs of spontaneous breathing."

This means that the blood flow in the veins of the lower limb has two distinct phases: a systolic phase, during which blood flows into the veins from the arteries, and a diastolic phase, during which blood flows out of the veins and back into the arteries. This biphasic flow pattern is typical of veins in the lower limbs, and is important for maintaining adequate blood flow to the muscles and other tissues of the lower limbs."
