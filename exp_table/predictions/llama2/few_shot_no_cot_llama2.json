      "The oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of fluid entering it. Glomerular capillaries have a specialized structure that allows for the formation of a high-pressure, low-resistance filter. The afferent arteriole, which leads to the glomerulus, has a larger diameter and a higher blood flow rate than the efferent arteriole, which leaves the glomerulus. This creates a pressure gradient that helps to drive filtration. The glomerular capillaries are also highly permeable, allowing for the passage of large molecules such as proteins and plasma proteins. The combination of high pressure and high permeability results in the formation of a large amount of filtrate. The filtrate then passes through the renal tubules, where it is either reabsorbed or secreted, depending on the needs of the body. The final product of the renal tubules is urine."

      "Axonal transport is the movement of molecules along the length of a neuron's axon. It is a vital process that allows neurons to maintain their structure and function. There are two types of axonal transport: antegrade and retrograde. Antegrade transport refers to the movement of molecules from the cell body towards the axon terminal, while retrograde transport refers to the movement of molecules from the axon terminal back to the cell body. Both types of transport are essential for the survival and proper functioning of neurons."

      "Low insulin to glucagon ratio is seen in all of these except: Glycogen synthesis. Insulin and glucagon are two hormones that play important roles in regulating glucose metabolism. Insulin promotes the uptake and storage of glucose, while glucagon stimulates the breakdown of glucose stores. In glycogen synthesis, insulin promotes the conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver and muscles. Therefore, a low insulin to glucagon ratio would not be seen in glycogen synthesis, as insulin levels would be high."
