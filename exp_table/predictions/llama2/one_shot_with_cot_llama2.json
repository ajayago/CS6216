      "The oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of fluid entering it. This is because the glomerular capillaries have a semipermeable membrane that allows small molecules such as water, ions, and nutrients to pass through, but not large molecules like proteins. As a result, the concentration of large molecules in the glomerular filtrate is higher than that in the blood entering the capillaries, leading to a higher oncotic pressure in the glomerular filtrate. This increases the filtration pressure and helps to drive the filtration process."

It provides information on the velocity and volume of blood flow in the arteries and veins. The characteristic of venous blood flow in the lower limb in duplex Doppler is biphasic, meaning it has two distinct phases: the systolic phase and the diastolic phase. In the systolic phase, blood flow is rapid and occurs during the contraction of the heart muscle, while in the diastolic phase, blood flow is slower and occurs during the relaxation of the heart muscle. The biphasic pattern is seen in healthy individuals and is important for assessing the adequacy of blood flow to the limbs."
