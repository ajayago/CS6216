      "The oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of fluid entering it. This is because the capillary walls are permeable to water and solutes, allowing fluid to escape into the interstitial space. As a result, the concentration of solutes in the capillary fluid increases, which increases the oncotic pressure. Therefore, option 0 is incorrect. Glucose concentration in the capillaries is the same as that in glomerular filtrate. Constriction of afferent arteriole decreases the blood flow to the glomeruli, which can decrease the glomerular filtration rate and lead to a decrease in the amount of glucose in the glomerular filtrate. Hematocrit of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of the fluid entering it, as the capillaries are permeable to water and solutes, allowing fluid to escape into the interstitial space."
