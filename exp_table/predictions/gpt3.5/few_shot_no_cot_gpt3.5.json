    "explanation (cot)": ["The oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the glomerular capillaries is greater than that of the fluid entering them. This is due to the filtration of plasma proteins at the glomerulus, leading to an increase in oncotic pressure as fluid moves through the capillaries. This helps in retaining proteins and larger molecules within the blood. Refer: Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology, 25th Edition, page 440"],

    "explanation (cot)": ["Axonal transport is the process by which proteins, organelles, and other materials are transported along the axon of a neuron. It can occur in both anterograde (from the cell body towards the axon terminal) and retrograde (from the axon terminal towards the cell body) directions. This bidirectional transport is essential for maintaining neuronal function and communication. Reference: Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, et al. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 4th edition.

The needle is connected to a syringe, and blood is withdrawn from the artery. The blood is then sent to the lab for testing.* Before performing an ABG, the syringe should be loaded with 0.3 cc of heparin, and the needle should be connected to a plastic extension tubing.* The usual sites for ABG are the radial or brachial arteries. If the modified Allen's test is negative, a different site should be tried.* The radial artery is the preferred site for arterial puncture due to its superficial location, collateral circulation, and relatively low incidence of complications."],
