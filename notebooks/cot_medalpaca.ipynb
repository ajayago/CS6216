The oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of fluid entering it Guyton I LpJ1 4-.;anong 23/e p653-6_)Glomerular oncotic pressure (due to plasma protein content) is higher than that of filtrate oncotic pressure in Bowman\\'s capsule\"Since glucose is freely filtered and the fluid in the Bowman\\'s capsule is isotonic with plasma, the concentration of glucose in the filtrate is the same as in the capillaries. \\nQuestion: Axonal transport is: A)Antegrade B)Retrograde C)Antegrade and retrograde D)None.
